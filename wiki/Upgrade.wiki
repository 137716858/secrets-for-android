|| UNDER CONSTRUCTION ||

= Introduction =

Changing mobile phone seems inevitable.  Maybe the phone is lost or stolen, maybe it breaks, or maybe you just want the latest and greatest.  Easily transferring secrets to a new phone is an important issue for all users of *_Secrets for Android_*.

This page describes two ways to ensure that your secrets make it to your new phone.  Note that for best results you will need to perform some actions before you stop using your existing phone.  Please take the time to follow the recommended steps below before disaster strikes!  These steps work for Android tablets as well.

= Method 1: Online Backup =

Android provides a built-in mechanism to backup your apps and data to your Google account.  This is by far the easiest way to transfer secrets to a new phone.  It may also be the only way to do so in the case of lost, stolen or damaged phones.

Online backup must be enabled before it will function and is normally done when you first configure your phone.  If you didn't do it then or want to check if its enabled, do the following:

(steps for Android 4+)
  * start the "Settings" apps
  * tap "Backup & reset"
  * make sure that the items "Back up my data" and "Automatic restore" are checked

Take note of the email address listed under "Backup account" as this is the Google account that will store your phone's information.  Do this for your phone right now, and for all your new phones in the future.

When you configure your new phone, make sure to use the same email address as was shown under "Backup account".  Most of your apps will automatically be restored, some even with their data.  In particular, *_Secrets for Android_* will be restored on your phone along with all your secrets.

== Check the Online Backup ==

To further check that backups are properly enabled, verify the state of the online information stored with your Google account:

  * open a web browser and go to the page https://www.google.com/dashboard
  * make sure you are logged in with the account noted under "Backup account" above
  * scroll down to the section called "Android devices" and look for your phone
  * click the link "More data stored about this device" to see which apps have been backed up

If all is working correctly, you will see the name and time of the most recent backup for each apps that support online backup.

Keep in mind that if you just enabled backups as described above, it may take a day or so before the dashboard will show anything.

= Method 2: Manual Transfer =

If you are not using online backup, then you must manually transfer your secrets from your old phone to your new phone.  These instructions should apply to any phone running Android 2.3.3 or later.  A PC is also required.

Before beginning, make sure that the USB computer connection mode on the phones --- both the old phone and new phone ---  is set correctly by doing the following:

  * start the "Settings" apps
  * tap "Storage"
  * tap MENU and select "USB computer connection"
  * Under "Connect as", make sure that "Media device (MTP)" is selected
  * tap HOME to exit the Settings app

Don't forget to do the above steps on both phones.

  * Start *_Secrets for Android_* and enter the app

  * exit *_Secrets for Android_*
  * connect the old phone to the PC using a USB cable
  * on the PC, open "My Computer"
