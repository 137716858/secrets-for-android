= Synchronize secrets with your PC =

If you've ever wanted to access your secrets on your PC, give Chris Wood's _*PCSecrets*_ a try.  You'll need the following:

  # _*PCSecrets*_ running on the PC.  Get it from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcsecrets/files/?source=navbar sourceforge].
  # _*PCSSync*_, a companion android app that keeps your secrets on the phone in sync with the PC.  Get it directly from the [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ceperman.sync Play Store].

Chris and I worked closely together to make sync as easy and secure as possible.  Let us know what you think on the [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/secrets-for-android discuss forum].

== Transfer Secrets to a New Phone ==

PCSecrets is also a good way to transfer secrets to a new phone.  First make sure to keep your existing phone in sync with your PC.  When you get a new phone, install _*Secrets for Android*_ and _*PCSSync*_, and sync.  You're done!
