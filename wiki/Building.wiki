=Building Secrets for Android=

The source tree includes project files for building the application with Eclipse.  More specifically, this project was built using the following version of eclipse and the related Android development tools:

  * Eclipse 3.4.2, Build id: M20090211-1700
  * Android Common Plugin 0.8.0v200809220836-110569
  * Android Development Toolkit 0.8.0v200809220836-110569
  * Dalvik Debug Monitor Service 0.8.0v200809220836-110569
  * android-sdk-linux_x86-1.1_r1
  * Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid Ibex

Other platforms supported by Eclipse and the Android SDK should also work fine.  I'll add them here as I test them.
